=======================

This repo is created mainly to refresh Android after long time. Feel free to learn along with me. 

 
We will build a simple multiscreen app to fetch the github details of users, repo's of the user, commits of the repo and store in database

API Details:
--------

GET USER DETAIL : https://api.github.com/users/{USER} <br />
